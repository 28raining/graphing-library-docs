### Initialization for Online Plotting1212

Chart Studio provides a web-service for hosting graphs! Create a [free account](https://plotly.com/api_signup) to get started. Graphs are saved inside your online Chart Studio account and you control the privacy. Public hosting is free, for private hosting, check out our [paid plans](https://plotly.com/products/cloud/).
<br>
<br>
After installing the Chart Studio package, you're ready to fire up python:
<br>
<br>
`$ python`
<br>
<br>
and set your credentials:

```python
import chart_studio
chart_studio.tools.set_credentials_file(username='DemoAccount', api_key='lr1c37zw81')
```
<!-- #region -->

You'll need to replace **'DemoAccount'** and **'lr1c37zw81'** with _your_ Plotly username and [API key](https://plotly.com/settings/api).<br>
Find your API key [here](https://plotly.com/settings/api).
<br>
<br>
The initialization step places a special **.plotly/.credentials** file in your home directory. Your **~/.plotly/.credentials** file should look something like this:
<br>

```
{
    "username": "DemoAccount",
    "stream_ids": ["ylosqsyet5", "h2ct8btk1s", "oxz4fm883b"],
    "api_key": "lr1c37zw81"
}
```
<!-- #endregion -->

### Online Plot Privacy

Plot can be set to three different type of privacies: public, private or secret.

- **public**: Anyone can view this graph. It will appear in your profile and can appear in search engines. You do not need to be logged in to Chart Studio to view this chart.
- **private**: Only you can view this plot. It will not appear in the Plotly feed, your profile, or search engines. You must be logged in to Plotly to view this graph. You can privately share this graph with other Chart Studio users in your online Chart Studio account and they will need to be logged in to view this plot.
- **secret**: Anyone with this secret link can view this chart. It will not appear in the Chart Studio feed, your profile, or search engines. If it is embedded inside a webpage or an IPython notebook, anybody who is viewing that page will be able to view the graph. You do not need to be logged in to view this plot.

By default all plots are set to **public**. Users with free account have the permission to keep one private plot. If you need to save private plots, [upgrade to a pro account](https://plotly.com/plans). If you're a [Personal or Professional user](https://plotly.com/settings/subscription/?modal=true&utm_source=api-docs&utm_medium=support-oss) and would like the default setting for your plots to be private, you can edit your Chart Studio configuration:

```python
import chart_studio
chart_studio.tools.set_config_file(world_readable=False,
                             sharing='private')
```

For more examples on privacy settings please visit [Python privacy documentation](https://plotly.com/python/privacy/)

### Special Instructions for [Chart Studio Enterprise](https://plotly.com/product/enterprise/) Users

Your API key for account on the public cloud will be different than the API key in Chart Studio Enterprise. Visit https://plotly.your-company.com/settings/api/ to find your Chart Studio Enterprise API key. Remember to replace "your-company.com" with the URL of your Chart Studio Enterprise server.
If your company has a Chart Studio Enterprise server, change the Python API endpoint so that it points to your company's Plotly server instead of Plotly's cloud.
<br>
<br>
In python, enter:

```python
import chart_studio
chart_studio.tools.set_config_file(plotly_domain='https://plotly.your-company.com',
                             plotly_streaming_domain='https://stream-plotly.your-company.com')
```

Make sure to replace **"your-company.com"** with the URL of _your_ Chart Studio Enterprise server.

Additionally, you can set your configuration so that you generate **private plots by default**. For more information on privacy settings see: https://plotly.com/python/privacy/<br>
<br>
In python, enter:

```python
import chart_studio
chart_studio.tools.set_config_file(plotly_domain='https://plotly.your-company.com',
                             plotly_streaming_domain='https://stream-plotly.your-company.com',
                             world_readable=False,
                             sharing='private')
```
