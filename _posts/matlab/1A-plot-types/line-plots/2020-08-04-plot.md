## Create Line Plot

> Create <var>x</var> as a vector of linearly spaced values between 0 and 2π. Use an increment of π/100 between the values. Create <var>y</var> as sine values of <var>x</var>. Create a line plot of the data.

<pre class="mcode">
x = 0:pi/100:2*pi;
y = sin(x);
plot(x,y)

fig2plotly()
</pre>

## Plot Multiple Lines

> Define x as 100 linearly spaced values between −2π and 2π. Define y1 and y2 as sine and cosine values of x. Create a line plot of both sets of data.

<pre class="mcode">
x = linspace(-2*pi,2*pi);
y1 = sin(x);
y2 = cos(x);

figure
plot(x,y1,x,y2)

## Create Line Plot From Matrix

> Define Y as the 4-by-4 matrix returned by the magic function.

<pre class="mcode">
Y = magic(4)
</pre>

> Create a 2-D line plot of Y. MATLAB® plots each matrix column as a separate line.

<pre class="mcode">
figure
plot(Y)
