## Create Surface Plot

> Create three matrices of the same size. Then plot them as a surface. The surface plot uses Z for both height and color.

<pre class="mcode">
[X,Y] = meshgrid(1:0.5:10,1:20);
Z = sin(X) + cos(Y);
surf(X,Y,Z)

fig2plotly()
</pre>

## Specify Colormap Colors for Surface Plot

> Specify the colors for a surface plot by including a fourth matrix input, C. The surface plot uses Z for height and C for color. Specify the colors using a colormap, which uses single numbers to stand for colors on a spectrum. When you use a colormap, C is the same size as Z. Add a color bar to the graph to show how the data values in C correspond to the colors in the colormap.

<pre class="mcode">
[X,Y] = meshgrid(1:0.5:10,1:20);
Z = sin(X) + cos(Y);
C = X.*Y;
surf(X,Y,Z,C)
