## Create Surface Plot

> Create three matrices of the same size. Then plot them as a surface. The surface plot uses Z for both height and color.

<pre class="mcode">
[X,Y] = meshgrid(1:0.5:10,1:20);
Z = sin(X) + cos(Y);
surf(X,Y,Z)

fig2plotly()
</pre>

<!--------------------- EXAMPLE BREAK ------------------------->
## Specify Colormap Colors for Surface Plot

> Specify the colors for a surface plot by including a fourth matrix input, C. The surface plot uses Z for height and C for color. Specify the colors using a colormap, which uses single numbers to stand for colors on a spectrum. When you use a colormap, C is the same size as Z. Add a color bar to the graph to show how the data values in C correspond to the colors in the colormap.

<pre class="mcode">
[X,Y] = meshgrid(1:0.5:10,1:20);
Z = sin(X) + cos(Y);
C = X.*Y;
surf(X,Y,Z,C)
colorbar

## Specify True Colors for Surface Plot

> Specify the colors for a surface plot by including a fourth matrix input, <var>CO</var>. The surface plot uses <var>Z</var> for height and <var>CO</var> for color. Specify the colors using truecolor, which uses triplets of numbers to stand for all possible colors. When you use truecolor, if <var>Z</var> is <var>m</var>-by-<var>n</var>, then <var>CO</var> is <var>m</var>-by-<var>n</var>-by-3. The first page of the array indicates the red component for each color, the second page indicates the green component, and the third page indicates the blue component.



<pre class="mcode">
[X,Y,Z] = peaks(25);
CO(:,:,1) = zeros(25); % red
CO(:,:,2) = ones(25).*linspace(0.5,0.6,25); % green
CO(:,:,3) = ones(25).*linspace(0,1,25); % blue
surf(X,Y,Z,CO)

## Modify Surface Plot Appearance

> Create a semitransparent surface by specifying the FaceAlpha name-value pair with 0.5 as the value. To allow further modifications, assign the surface object to the variable <var>s</var>.



<pre class="mcode">
[X,Y] = meshgrid(-5:.5:5);
Z = Y.*sin(X) - X.*cos(Y);
s = surf(X,Y,Z,'FaceAlpha',0.5)
